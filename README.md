## Description

This React app lets users create flashcards and organizes them using AI. The AI sorts the flashcards into categories based on how they are related, making studying and learning easier and more organized.

## Instructions

- Download:
  - git clone the repo
- Install:
  - install node if you do not have it
  - On the terminal run:
    - 'npm install'
    - 'npm install -g vercel'
    - 'vercel login'
- Run:
  - 'vercel dev' (this is our equivalent to 'npm start' but allows us to use the backend when devoloping locally)

if you run into issues when downloading and running the app, you can visit "https://new-quiz-mouse.vercel.app/" and use the product from there.

## How to use product

- Create an account
  - after entering your username and password you will be taken to the main page
- at this point, the main page will be empty
- hit "create" on the top left
- create real questions and answers (ideally about 6 questions and answers so that the AI has more information to make connections off of)
  - this will send you to the main page, at this point you should still see nothing
- create another flashcard set
  - after hitting save you should be sent back to the main page and now with 2 flashcard sets total, you should see relationships between the cards
- if you click on either flashcard set you will be sent to a test yourself page containing:
  - questions and answers you made
  - ability to shuffle, go to the previous, go to the next, and flip the card
- if you scroll down in that same page you will see connections made for the flashcard set that you are in
